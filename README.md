# Unzippy
A program to help with all of your unzipping needs!

Unzippy runs in the background and scans for zip files in your downloads folder

When one is detected you get to choose whether you want to unzip it or blacklist it

After selecting yes you will be prompted about where to unzip it downloads, desktop, documents, pictures

You may compile the code yourself with https://www.autohotkey.com
